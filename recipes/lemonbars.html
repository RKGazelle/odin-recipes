  <h2>Easy no-cook custard and a sharp zing of lemon flavor!</h2>
  <p>These lemon bars are always a hit when I make them- the recipe listed below is borrowed from 'Sally's Baking Addiction', but with my own edits from making the recipe so many times!</p>
  <p>My 'secret' is just adding a ton of lemon zest where the basic recipe calls for none. I usually zest every lemon I use for juice, which is anywhere from 4-8 depending on size / freshness.</p>
  <p>Note: This recipe can easily be halved and cooked in an 8x8 or 9x9 pan if you don't need the whole 13x9.</p>
