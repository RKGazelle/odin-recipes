  <h2>Rich and heavenly, the gnocchi in this recipe crisp up like a dream!</h2>
  <p>This recipe is straight from the New York Times Cooking website. I can't recommend subbing to them enough, their recipes are slam dunks every single time!</p>
  <p>I really can't rave about this one enough; the brussels and gnocchi complement each other wonderfully, but the cooking method and flavors truly shine here. The resulting dish if done properly yields gnocchi so crispy on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth soft on the inside it feels sinful to eat! The brussels get seared to perfection and have a wonderful flavor all their own.</p>

  <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 Pound Brussels Sprouts</li>
    <li>1 Lemon</li>
    <li>1/4 Cup Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Kosher Salt & Black Pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 Teaspoon Red Pepper Flakes</li>
    <li>1 (18oz.) Package Shelf-Stable Potato Gnocchi</li>
    <li>6 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter (sliced into 6 pieces)</li>
    <li>1/2 Teaspoon Honey</li>
    <li>Freshly Grated Parmesan</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Trim & halve the brussels sprouts. Using a vegetable peeler, peel thick strips of lemon zest, then coarsely chop. (This should yield ~2tsp zest)</li>
    <li>In a large (preferably 12-inch) skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Add the brussels sprouts, season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, then arrange the brussels sprouts in an even layer, cut-side down. Scatter the lemon zest over the top and cook, undisturbed, until the brussels sprouts are well browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes, stir and cook until the brussels are crisp-tender, 2-3min.</li>
    <li>In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high. Break up any gnocchi that are stuck together, add them to the pan and cook, covered and undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the butter and honey, season with salt and a generous amount of black pepper,and cook, stirring, until the butter is golden, nutty smelling and foaming, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the brussels sprouts until warmed through. Serve with grated parmesan.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>I find this recipe benefits from a little longer cooking time at all stages, but generally you should go by your senses and the look and feel of the food. If the brussels are good and seared dark brown on the bottom, they're probably done; if the gnocchi has a really nice crisp texture, it's done. Don't overthink it!</li>
    <li>Take extreme care not to over-crowd the pan with the brussels. A 12-inch pan should be fine for 1 pound, but if you bought a 1.5 pound bag or something, you will ruin this if you fill the pan too much. Every single sprout should be able to sit cut-side down directly on the pan or this will not work properly!</li>
  </ul>
