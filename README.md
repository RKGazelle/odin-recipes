# odin-recipes

This simple project will create a small website that links to recipe pages from a homepage.

This project should involve the basic setup of several HTML pages, connection between the pages, and basic text/image formatting.

This project will also serve as a way to practice with atomic commits / basic git management, as well as practice formatting a commit message properly.
